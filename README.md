# simple-jsdom

A simple JSDom configuration that I use when testing most of my libraries.

### Motivation

JSDom is incredibly powerful and full of features, but I use a very small subset of
its API. Most of the time, I simply want my tests for client-side JavaScript to not
explode when I run them in the Node environment.

Require this configuration and your tests should Just WorkÂ©.

### Versioning

This library intentionally depends on JSDom `^3.0`, as that is the last version
of JSDom to support Node. Newer versions are for io.js only. Most developers use Node,
so it doesn't make sense to upgrade.

### Features

The following global variables are created:

- `document`
- `window`
- `navigator`

These objects should have the methods and properties expected for most basic client-side
operations.
