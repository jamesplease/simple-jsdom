# simple-jsdom
[![Travis build status](http://img.shields.io/travis/jmeas/simple-jsdom.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/jmeas/simple-jsdom)

A simple JSDom configuration for testing libraries.

### Installation

The easiest way to get simple-jsdom is through npm.

`npm i simple-jsdom --save-dev`

You'll also need to install the version of JSDom that you'd like to use.

`npm i jsdom --save-dev`

### Getting Started

To modify the global namespace, run:

`require('simple-jsdom').install();`

### Motivation

Most of the time that I use JSDom, I only want to make it so that my client side tests
work in a Node environment without blowing up. I'm less interested in thinking
about how JSDom works.

I found myself copying and pasting the same code between projects, so I abstracted into
this bare bones JSDom configuration. Require this in and your tests should Just WorkÂ©.

For instance, you should be able to use most (all?) of the jQuery API after you've included this.

### Versioning

This library requires Node v4+ and JSDom v8+.

### API

This module returns two things: a `globals` object, which returns the globals created by JSDom,
and an `install` method, which attaches those things to the global namespace.

The four objects are:

- `document`
- `window`
- `navigator`
- [`jsdom`](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom#for-the-hardcore-jsdomjsdom)
